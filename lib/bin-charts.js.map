That is important for the improvement of the user experience\n * when dragging something near the boundary without being terminated unexpectedly.\n *\n * We originally consider to introduce new events like `pagemovemove` and `pagemouseup`\n * to resolve this issue. But some drawbacks of it is described in\n * https://github.com/ecomfe/zrender/pull/536#issuecomment-560286899\n *\n * Instead, we referenced the specifications:\n * https://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events/#the-touchmove-event\n * https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20140925/#event-type-mousemove\n * where the the mousemove/touchmove can be continue to fire if the user began a drag\n * operation and the pointer has left the boundary. (for the mouse event, browsers\n * only do it on `document` and when the pointer has left the boundary of the browser.)\n *\n * So the default `HandlerProxy` supports this feature similarly: if it is in the dragging\n * state (see `pointerCapture` in `HandlerProxy`), the `mousemove` and `mouseup` continue\n * to fire until release the pointer. That is implemented by listen to those event on\n * `document`.\n * If we implement some other `HandlerProxy` only for touch device, that would be easier.\n * The touch event support this feature by default.\n *\n * Note:\n * There might be some cases that the mouse event can not be\n * received on `document`. For example,\n * (A) `useCapture` is not supported and some user defined event listeners on the ancestor\n * of zr dom throw Error .\n * (B) `useCapture` is not supported Some user defined event listeners on the ancestor of\n * zr dom call `stopPropagation`.\n * In these cases, the `mousemove` event might be keep triggered event\n * if the mouse is released. We try to reduce the side-effect in those cases.\n * That is, do nothing (especially, `findHover`) in those cases. See `isOutsideBoundary`.\n *\n * Note:\n * If `HandlerProxy` listens to `document` with `useCapture`, `HandlerProxy` needs to\n * make sure `stopPropagation` and `preventDefault` doing nothing if and only if the event\n * target is not zrender dom. Becuase it is dangerous to enable users to call them in\n * `document` capture phase to prevent the propagation to any listener of the webpage.\n * But they are needed to work when the pointer inside the zrender dom.\n */\nvar SILENT = 'silent';\n\nfunction makeEventPacket(eveType, targetInfo, event) {\n  return {\n    type: eveType,\n    event: event,\n    // target can only be an element that is not silent.\n    target: targetInfo.target,\n    // topTarget can be a silent element.\n    topTarget: targetInfo.topTarget,\n    cancelBubble: false,\n    offsetX: event.zrX,\n    offsetY: event.zrY,\n    gestureEvent: event.gestureEvent,\n    pinchX: event.pinchX,\n    pinchY: event.pinchY,\n    pinchScale: event.pinchScale,\n    wheelDelta: event.zrDelta,\n    zrByTouch: event.zrByTouch,\n    which: event.which,\n    stop: stopEvent\n  };\n}\n\nfunction stopEvent() {\n  eventTool.stop(this.event);\n}\n\nfunction EmptyProxy() {}\n\nEmptyProxy.prototype.dispose = function () {};\n\nvar handlerNames = ['click', 'dblclick', 'mousewheel', 'mouseout', 'mouseup', 'mousedown', 'mousemove', 'contextmenu'];\n/**\n * @alias module:zrender/Handler\n * @constructor\n * @extends module:zrender/mixin/Eventful\n * @param {module:zrender/Storage} storage Storage instance.\n * @param {module:zrender/Painter} painter Painter instance.\n * @param {module:zrender/dom/HandlerProxy} proxy HandlerProxy instance.\n * @param {HTMLElement} painterRoot painter.root (not painter.getViewportRoot()).\n */\n\nvar Handler = function (storage, painter, proxy, painterRoot) {\n  Eventful.call(this);\n  this.storage = storage;\n  this.painter = painter;\n  this.painterRoot = painterRoot;\n  proxy = proxy || new EmptyProxy();\n  /**\n   * Proxy of event. can be Dom, WebGLSurface, etc.\n   */\n\n  this.proxy = null;\n  /**\n   * {target, topTarget, x, y}\n   * @private\n   * @type {Object}\n   */\n\n  this._hovered = {};\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {Date}\n   */\n\n  this._lastTouchMoment;\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number}\n   */\n\n  this._lastX;\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number}\n   */\n\n  this._lastY;\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {module:zrender/core/GestureMgr}\n   */\n\n  this._gestureMgr;\n  Draggable.call(this);\n  this.setHandlerProxy(proxy);\n};\n\nHandler.prototype = {\n  constructor: Handler,\n  setHandlerProxy: function (proxy) {\n    if (this.proxy) {\n      this.proxy.dispose();\n    }\n\n    if (proxy) {\n      util.each(handlerNames, function (name) {\n        proxy.on && proxy.on(name, this[name], this);\n      }, this); // Attach handler\n\n      proxy.handler = this;\n    }\n\n    this.proxy = proxy;\n  },\n  mousemove: function (event) {\n    var x = event.zrX;\n    var y = event.zrY;\n    var isOutside = isOutsideBoundary(this, x, y);\n    var lastHovered = this._hovered;\n    var lastHoveredTarget = lastHovered.target; // If lastHoveredTarget is removed from zr (detected by '__zr') by some API call\n    // (like 'setOption' or 'dispatchAction') in event handlers, we should find\n    // lastHovered again here.
